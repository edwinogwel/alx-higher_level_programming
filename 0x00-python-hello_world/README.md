### The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.</br>
Explicit is better than implicit.</br>
Simple is better than complex.</br>
Complex is better than complicated.</br>
Flat is better than nested.</br>
Sparse is better than dense.</br>
Readability counts.</br>
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</br>
Although practicality beats purity.</br>
Errors should never pass silently.</br>
Unless explicitly silenced.</br>
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</br>
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</br>
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</br>
Now is better than never.</br>
Although never is often better than *right* now.</br>
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</br>
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</br>
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</br>
